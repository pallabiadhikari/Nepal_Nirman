<h1>About Nepal Nirman</h1>
<p><strong>Nepal Nirman</strong> is a citizen-driven platform that empowers individuals to report incidents, document injustices, and stay informed about civic issues. Our mission is to foster accountability and transparency by giving the public a voice and creating a secure space for evidence collection and reporting.</p>

<h2>Why Nepal Nirman?</h2>
<p>In many societies, civic issues such as corruption, discrimination, and injustice often go unreported due to fear or lack of access. Civic Hub aims to change that by providing a simple, safe, and secure platform where users can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Submit incident reports anonymously</li>
  <li>Attach evidence (photos, videos, documents)</li>
  <li>Track civic issues and election updates</li>
  <li>Access important contact numbers and legal rights</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight-box">
  <h2>Our Vision</h2>
  <p>To create an informed, empowered, and engaged society that holds institutions accountable and ensures justice for all.</p>
